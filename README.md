# Symptom-Progress-Data-Visualisation

For a Quality Improvement Project in 2020 at Hillingdon Hospital, London, I created these data visualisations for tracking Paediatric constipation symptom progress during treatment. 

For the data, I created a password-protected Qualtrics form which families could fill it on their phones at home. 

This was my first long-form data science project and I learned a lot about code best practices and Plotly.

THIS DATA HAS BEEN ANONYMISED.
